## Solving EMMs via Manifold Optimisation on an Approximate Wasserstein Distance
The code provided in this repo is related to the paper accepted at AAAI2020 (oral), which addresses a general problem of solving elliptical mixture models. This paper proposes an approximate Wasserstein distance to establish explicit statistical manifold for EMMs, followed by an advanced directional Adam algorithm to accelerate and stabilise convergence. Please refer to the paper for more details.
